- The wp-config.php file contains all your settings from database login details to debug
settings and hashes.

- You're free to modify the wp-config file without having to worry about it being overwritten
in the future updates.

- The wp-includes folder contains functions and classes used throughout WordPress. 
These functions and classes cannot go on their own, because the execution is happening
somewhere else. The wp-admin file handles everything on the admin side of WordPress.

- The wp-content folder contains all content created by the user and also stores all plugins and themes.

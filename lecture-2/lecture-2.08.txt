Problems with loading CSS from templates:
    1. Users being able to actually change the default WordPress folder structure to suit their needs
    rendering our fixed links useless.
    2. We would also have to check if SSL is enabled. Forcing us to check if the protocil is 
    https or http. 
    3. Lastly, you'll end up loading all stylesheets and scripts on every page even if we do not need them.

- WordPress will search for a file called functions.php. This file is completely optional. 
You can add logic to do heavy lifting behind the scenes. you can group functionalities
in several folders.

- The developer tools allow you to diagnose and debug your site. The console tab will output 
any messages and errors related to your site. In other words, INSPECT the page. 

- Action hooks allow you to hook into certain events. If an event occurs, then any functions
that hook into the event will be triggered. 
    syntax: add_action($event, $function_to_be_executed, $priority, $arguments_accepted)
    
- It is important that you prefix your functions, classes and variables so you can avoid any 
naming conflicts with other code from plugins and the WordPress core.

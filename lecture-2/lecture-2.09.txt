- It is always important to register scripts/stylesheets before enqueueing them. Registering will let Wordpress
know about your files while enqueueing will instruct WordPress to lose the files.

- Prefix your file handle names to avoid collision and naming conflicts with other plugins/themes.

- Use the wp_head and wp_footer functions to instruct WordPress where to load your files.

- It's important that you never override WordPress' default scripts such as jQuery.

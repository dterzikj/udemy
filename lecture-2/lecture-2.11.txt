- You can use WordPress' built-in features by calling the add_theme_support()
function and pass in the feature you would like to take advantage of.

- Once the menu feature is active, then you can register a menu using the 
register_nav_menu() function.

- After a menu has been registered you can display it using the wp_nav_menu()
function. If you have a menu with CSS classes for each item, then you'll need
to use a custom walker to output those classes.

- WordPress provides a few functions for translating strings. If WordPress
does not find a translation, then WordPress will return the string as it is.

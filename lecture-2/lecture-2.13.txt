- Sidebars can be placed inside their own template files called sidebar.php.
You can grab a sidebar using the function get_sidebar().

- Sidebars also follow the same naming convetions as the header and footer.

- It's important that you keep your HTML/CSS for the widgets minimal as it can be hard
to maintain with WordPress.

- Make sure to check if a sidebar is active using the is_active_sidebar() function.
And then call a dynamic_sidebar().

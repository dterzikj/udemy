- WordPress will search for a file called searchform.php and use it as a template 
for the search form displayed inside the search widget. 

- If the template is not found WordPress will automatically call the function
get_search_form() which will generate a search form.

- It's important that you set the method to GET and that the input field has
a name of 's'.

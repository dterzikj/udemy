- The Loop is a way to allow developers to loop through an array of posts. 
The number posts in an array varies from page to page.

- In order to use post thumbnails you have to add support for it by calling
add_theme_support('post-thumbnails');

- Template tags are functions that will retrieve information about the current
page or post. They can be used inside or outside a loop.

- Beware of using the_date() inside the loop. There are a lot of problems that
come with this function. It is better to use the get_the_date() function
instead. 

- Post thumbnails come in various sizes. By default there 4 size aliases that
WordPress defines for you. The original size of an image can be grabbed by using the 
full size alias. 

- WordPress provides 2 functions for pagination which are the previous_posts_link()
and next_posts_link().

- The template hierarchy is what WordPress uses to determine what template
file to load. The default template is the index.php file (remember diagram).

- WordPress theme development codex provides recommendations for what each 
template should have (like the one for the single post).

- Quick tags allow you to insert code into a post that wil be dynamically changed
depending on the quick tag used (like <!--nextpage-->, but wp_link_pages() should
be used). The <!--nextpage--> quick tag allows you to paginate a post.

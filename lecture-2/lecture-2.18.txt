- You can create a template for comments by creating a file called comments.php

- It's important to check if the current post is password protected using the
post_password_required() function.

- The comment_form() function will display a form while also taking the time to
perform additional checks before displaying the form. 

- WordPress saves all comments inside a global variable named comments which
is available for access inside a loop.

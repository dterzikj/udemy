Benefits of using the WP_Query class:
	- To add a list of related posts under the current post for example
	a list of all posts in the same category.

	- To create two loops on the same page: for example a FAQ page
	with the question titles at the top of the content beneath.

	- To create a custom list of recent posts in the sidebar or footer
	of your site, when the Recent Posts widget does not do what
	you need (or you'd rather code it yourself).

	- To create custom queries for taxonomies using more than one 
	taxonomy to define what's displayed.

	- To query post types which aren't output by the default query,
	such as attachments. 

Disadvantages of using the WP_Query Class:
	- If all you want to do is change the way posts are being displayed
	for a particular content type or archive, do not use WP_Query. Instead
	simply create a template file for that archive or content type 
	and modify the loop in that template file.
	- If you want to display a few more or less posts than would 
	normally be shown on an archive, do not use WP_Query to create
	a whole new query. Instead use pre_get_posts to modify the main
	query, along with a conditional tag to single out where 
	exactly you want to do it.

- The WP_Query class allows you to query the database for posts. The query
automatically created and executed for you/

- There are 2 kinds of loops. Main loops and secondary loops. Main loops are
generated by WordPress. Secondary loops are created by you.

- It's important that you manage your loops carefully. If you have to use 
the loop multiple times, then you should make sure to reset it after you are
finished.

- The WP_Query class is very powerful. It's used in many themes and plugins multiple
times. It's important that you make sure it's perfect for the job.
